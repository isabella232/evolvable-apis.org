Even more so, when the deployment and update of the consumers is specially challenging, as happens with native mobile applications and even more so, consumers present in IoT devices.</p><article id="1"><h2>What makes an API Evolvable?</h2><p>Long story short, an evolvable APIs is an API that has been designed to facilitate seamless evolution. This is achieved through set of characteristics, design principles and capabilities that confer the API the capability of evolving and adapting to changes without breaking clients that are already consuming it. And at the same time they allow clients to use them in a way that can discover new capabilities and enhance its behaviour automatically when that evolution happens.</p><p>This could sounds like an chasing “El Dorado”, like an impossible goal to reach, but in fact it is not.</p><p>The web is almost 30 years old. If something has been proven key, is the capability of the Web to evolve gracefully over the years.</p><p>Can we learn something from the web? Can we reuse any of its design principles for our own Web APIs? Can we prepare them to evolve as seamlessly as the Web?</p><p>If we take a look at how some APIs are built today, we could think that unfortunately we can’t. It’s common in these days to be forced to update clients because a minor feature has been removed, changed or added in the server side.  Any API can become more evolvable and it’s our goal to show how.</p><p>But we think that, when necessary, we can bring some of those design principles and characteristics into the way we design and build Web APIs and take most of the benefits of Evolvability.</p></article><article id="2"><h2>Should your API be evolvable?</h2><p>The quick answer is “It depends”. This is not a matter of black and white, of what is right and what is wrong. We are not trying to establish what is better in absolute terms.</p><p>Whenever it comes to designing your Web API, the first question you should ask yourself is What are your -or your customer’s- needs?</p><p>To facilitate with the decision making, this website has been organized in the form of some introductory articles to provide base knowledge and a collection of recipes. Each recipe addresses a real world challenge and proposes one or more ways to solve it following an evolvable approach. The recipes explain the context as well as the benefits and costs to facilitate deciding whether it should be applied to your particular scenario.</p><p>Maybe you will discover that some solutions or techniques are a great fit for your API while others are not. That’s perfectly fine, nobody knows better than you what your API needs.</p><p></p><div class="docs-list row"><div class="col-md-4"><div class="docs-item"><a href="/docs/introduction/techniques.html"><span>Foundational techniques to make your APIs evolvable</span></a></div></div><div class="col-md-4"><div class="docs-item"><a href="/docs/introduction/versioning.html"><span>Versioning your API contract</span></a></div></div></div><p></p></article><input type="hidden" value="Introduction to Evolvable APIs"><input type="hidden" value="Evolvable APIs"></div><div class="contribute"><div class="contribute-img"><span class="icon-16-github"></span></div><div class="contribute-text"><p>Contribute on Github! <a href="https://github.com/liferay/evolvable-apis.org/tree/master/src/pages/docs/introduction/index.md" class="contribute-link" target="_blank">Edit this section</a>.</p></div></div></div><nav class="col-xs-16 col-md-offset-2 col-md-5"><div class="docs-nav-container"><div class="affix-top docs-nav"><div ref="readingContainer"></div></div></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><script src="/js/bundles/BOAps.js"></script><script>var data = '{"pageLocation":"index.children.docs.children.introduction","site":{"title":"Evolvable APIs","githubRepo":"liferay/evolvable-apis.org","googleAnalytics":"UA-37033501-12","index":{"title":"Home","description":"Embrace rapid evolution without breaking consumers.","srcFilePath":"src/pages/index.soy","id":"pages","location":"/./","url":"/./","children":{"docs":{"title":"Docs","url":"/docs/introduction/index.html","layout":false,"srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/index.soy","id":"docs","location":"/docs/","customURL":true,"children":{"search":{"description":"Documentation search results.","hidden":true,"title":"Search","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/search.soy","id":"search","location":"/docs/search.html","url":"/docs/search.html"},"introduction":{"title":"Introduction to Evolvable APIs","description":"Evolvable REST APIs are specially useful in contexts where the consumers are not written by the same development team as the server side API.
